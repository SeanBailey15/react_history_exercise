# React History Exercise

## Description

In this exercise students are tasked with refactoring a React app that was created using class-based Components by utilizing functional Components instead. The app itself displays "cheesy" jokes. There is a button to get a new set of jokes at the top of the page. Each joke is accompanied by buttons that allow a user to upvote/downvote each joke individually. There is also behind the scenes filtering that ensures the user does not see the same joke twice. For the sake of my course deadline (and therefore my wallet), I chose to skip any styling on this exercise, focusing instead on honing my React skills.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository :

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SeanBailey15/react_history_exercise.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory :

   ```bash
   cd react_history_exercise
   ```

3. Install the dependencies :

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the app :

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

\*_The terminal window will display a `Ctrl + click`-able link to the app_

## Now What?

Have a blast rolling your eyes or splitting your sides at some seriously cheesy jokes! Also check out the functionality of the app, I guess ðŸ˜œ
